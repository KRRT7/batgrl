nurses_2 FAQ
############

What's up with the name?
------------------------
The original nurses was a portmanteau of NumPy and curses. nurses_2 no longer
depends on curses, but I kept the name. A project rename is imminent.

Why a library for terminal graphics?
------------------------------------
I like to create visualizations in the terminal. Mostly for the yearly programming event,
`Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com/>`_
(`See my AoC visualizations! <https://github.com/salt-die/Advent-of-Code>`_),
but also just for fun.

Can you add or change X?
-----------------------------
Probably. Open an issue or find me (salt-die) on the `python discord <https://discord.com/invite/python>`_.
